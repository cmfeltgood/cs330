PLP 3: Functions

Functions in C++ are defined similarly to in Java. 
The general format is:

`type functionName(inputType inputName, otherType otherName) {code;}`

To return a primative from the function:

`return (primative);`

However, if you want to return something more complex than an average primative, you need to return pointers to that object.

I will figure this part out this week as a part of my final project.
