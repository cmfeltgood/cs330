PLP 3: Functions

Functions in C++ are defined similarly to in Java. 
The general format is:

type functionName(inputType inputName, otherType otherName) {code;}

To return a primative from the function:

return (primative);

However, if you want to return something more complex than an average primative, you need to return pointers to that object.
