PLP 4: Conditionals, Switch Statements, and Short Circuiting

First let's start with conditionals.
These use the same exact format as Java, i.e.:

`if (b > a){code;}`

with the same operators as Java uses (<,>,==,!=,etc.,&&,||)

For switch statements, they also work similarly to Java.
```
switch(variable) {
  case (some thing variable might be exactly equal to):
    code;
  etc.
}
```
Notably, we use colons here, which is odd for C++, but it works in this specific instance.

As shown in the short circuit code, C++ does use short circuiting.
