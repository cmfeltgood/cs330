### The Origins of C++

C++ originated as a better version of C. The "++" in the name means incremented in the language, implying C++ as an updated version. 
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, starting in 1979. Stroustrup mainly focused on implementing object-oriented features, although he added other improvements as well.
C++ was realease to the public in 1985, along with the first commercial compilier, Cfront. Later, from 1989 to 1995, a committe of the Amercian National Standarn Institute, worked to standardize the language, finally releasing an official standard in 1998.
This standard would be updated in 2003 and 2011, as both ideal new features and issues with the language were reported.
Nowadays, C++ is used commonly for browsers and operating systems, although it also gets used commonly for many other misc. purposes.



### The "Hello World!" Experience

I wanted to use VSCode for my programming, as it's what I use for other languages. This, however, turned out to be a challenge to figure out.
Basically, while there are extensions for VSCode that will work with C++, to get the compiler to work, you need to download the compiler, then open your VSCode project via a command prompt window. I especially struggled when the VSCode website just told me to "change directory as needed" without telling me how, as if everyone has command prompt commands memorized.
After all that effort though, I got it to work!
