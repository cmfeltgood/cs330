PLP 3: Functions

Functions in C++ are defined similarly to in Java. 
The general format is:
```
returnType functionName(inputType inputName, otherType otherName) {code;}
```
To return a aingle value from the function:
```
return (varName)
```
However, if you want to return multiple value from a function, it may require something more complex, 
especially when returning values of different variable types.
