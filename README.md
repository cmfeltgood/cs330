Hello, and welcome to my C++ tutorial!

This was made as a project for my programming languages class, while I self-learned C++

I definitely could have done a better job with this with the knowledge I have now, so I do apologize for any inacurracies / messy descriptions.

For the tutorials themselves, read the plpX.md files, in order. Aditional examples are provided as well.
